## ðŸ’» About:

**RENTX** is a React Native app to rent cars.
The interface followed the best practices to a better User Experience. <br />
In this project I learned about animations in React Native and how they impact the experience of the user and improved my knowledge in navigation, interface creation and API consume/requests. <br />
The API is fake and Json Server was used to create it.

### **Features:**

- Animations to enhance UX;
- List rented cars;
- List available cars to rent;
- Period pick to rent the desired car;
- Fake API to list and rent cars;
- Splash Screen animated;
- Stack navigation;
